Welcome to Tea Time NYC! This is a personal hobbyist project to practice and learn front-end development.

I don't know much about tea yet, so join me in the process of learning!

This is an informative website that is centered around how to effectively brew various kinds of tea, as well as promoting ditching tea bags all together.

What kind of tea are you drinking? How much should you use? What brewing methods are there? How long should you steep to achieve certain strength levels and flavor? etc. etc. etc.

The world of tea seems to be vast and very customizable, as well as a one way ticket to mindfullness and improved health. I'm looking forward to learning more about it to implement into my daily life, as well as have an additional project to learn more about software engineering.
